			<br>
			<br>
			What's in a name?  Everything.  One can search the world over and find a common thread amongst all human cultures.  That thread is that there is power in knowing the name of a thing.  Names are given, names are found, names are created, and some names are hidden.  So then where does the name <i>Hexenrei</i> come from?
			<br>
			<br>
			Hexenrei is then a German word, or rather, a constructed German word.  The word <i>Hexen</i> translates to Witch in English.  The ending, <i>rei</i> is similar to how English uses <i>ery</i> to end some words (e.g. Bakery, Smithery).  We then have a word that means something close to a <i>Witchery</i>, or a place where Witching is done.  This is exactly what you will find here.

			<div id="text1">
			<br>
			<br>
			ALL SERVICES AT HEXENREI ARE DONATION BASED.  
			<br>
			<br>
			Pay what you want, including $0.00.  If you like your reading, consider donating.  If you didn't like your reading, no worries, no pressure, no payment.
			<br>
			<br>
			We offer divnation services.  
			<br>
			<br>
			Divinations are a kind of consultation with a third party.  That third party takes the form of a divinatory tool, most commonly a deck of tarot cards.  The tool used to divine is selected by the practicioner by looking at how well they resonate with it.  At Hexenrei, you will find Tarot, Runic, and Russian Card divinations being offered.  But what are the tools we use here all about?

		<div class="section_subtitle">A bit about Tarot</div>
			<div id="text1">
			<br>
			<br>
			Simply put, Tarot is a deck of cards with mysterious origins.  Some say they date back to times long forgotten, others say the Egyptians created them.  The most likely historical case that we can conclude is that the Tarot, as we have it today, originated in Italy around  
			<br>
			<br>
			A deck of Tarot cards usually consists of 78, although some decks may have more or less.
			<br>
			<br>
		</div>
		<div class="section_subtitle">A bit about the Runes</div>
			<div id="text1">  
			<br>
			<br>
			Runes come from ancient Germanic tribes when these symbols were used as an alphabet.  Interestingly, the use of Runes as a divination tool is a fairly recent convention.  We do however have evidence of the old Norsemen using the runes to enscribe various spells and charms onto objects in an apparent effort to imbue those qualities into the item.  Appropriately enough, the word Rune itself means Mystery.
			<br>
			<br>
			Today, they are still used in this way, in addition to the divination facet that you will find here at Hexenrei.  We now have a meaning behind each letter, or Rune, that we use to build a reading.  Like the Tarot, we have certain layouts that give the symbols of the Runes a structure to build a narrative.
			<br>
			<br>
		</div>
		<div class="section_subtitle">A bit about the Russian Cards</div>
			<div id="text1">
			<br>
			<br>
			While we might not have the original set of cards, we can say that the current Russian Card set is based in traditional gypsy methods and symbols.  Reconstructed by Svetlana Alexandrovna Touchkoff, published in 1991, this unique deck captures traditional Russian methods of divination.
			<br>
			<br>
			The deck itself consists of 25 cards.  Each card has four images, each being a half image.  When the layout is complete, one looks for any half images that have again come together to form a full image.  These are where the meaning of the reading comes from, each full image having its own messages.

					<p>Three Card</p>
					<br>
					<p class="description">A three card reading is one of the most simple layouts one can work with.  However, this simplicity shouldn't be understood as an indication that it lacks in depth.  For this reading we will be able to get advice on the past, present, and future.  In other words, what was, is, and should be.</p>

					<p>Celtic Cross</p>
					<br>
					<p class="description">The Celtic Cross layout is one of the most commonly used layouts in Tarot readings.  There is a good reason for this.  The Celtic Cross is able to examine a specific question in great detail and only uses ten cards.  One is able to get a full view of the issue, where it comes from, what it's rooted in, things to look out for, and what might be in the future.</p>

					<p>The Pentagram</p>

					<p class="description">The Pentagram layout incorporates the timeless symbol of the Pentagram and its own elemental meanings into the symbols of the Tarot.  This layout provides one with an elemental picture of any situation, what lays rooted in Earth, what burns away in the Hearts Fire, what stirs in the Winds, what dives in the Waters, and what the true Spirit of the situation is.</p>

					<p>Journey</p>
					<br>
					<p class="description">The Journey layout is perfect for looking at your options.  The aspect this layout is best at focusing in on is ... the journey itself.  From the starting point in the present, we move forward, seeing what we might encounter if we choose certain paths.  At the end of the layout, we arrive at a destination, the result of all the possible paths.  Here we can see which roads look more promising on the way to where we are going.</p>

					<p class="description">The Branching Path layout let's us examine our choices in detail.  Here we can ask the question...what if...and get a good answer.  Starting at the present, we can see where each choice, each crossroad, might take us.  Here then we have a kind of branching timeline, a snapshot of all possibilities spreading out from where we are now in time.  The Branching Path might not give us a glimpse of a final destination, but it can give us a great map to navigate with.</p>

					<p>Duality</p>

A simple two card, pull, we can see all aspects of duality in regards to the issue being looked into.  What is strong and weak, what is known and unkown, what is now and later, what is to be accumulated and what is to be avoided...all dualites are revealed.  While it's true that subtlties might be lost here, this reading is perfect for getting a wide-view of a situation.</p>

					<p class="description">The Norns were agents of Fate in Norse mythology.  An interesting question arises from them and their prophecy...by divining the future are we simply exercising forsight, or are we in fact creating it?  Perhaps we may never find the answer, but in using this reading we might explore this question.  The Norn layout is a three Rune pull, one for each of the Norns.  We can catch a glimpse of our timeline in this, what was, is, and should be.</p>

The Nine Worlds reading can be applied to your own personal worlds or the worlds at large.  Combining the Runes with Norse Mythology, a unique and rich reading results.  A single rune is pulled for each realm, showing the state of affairs in the realm and in turn the worlds at large.</p>

The ones facing up are the ones who wish to speak.  Charting those runes showing, their spatial relation to each other, and at times utilizing the nine worlds map, an in depth rune reading results.  Always unpredictable, this method provides a truly free form result that is often suprising in what it wants to tell us.</p>

					<p class="description">The most simple and quick advice the runes can give.  Pulling one rune is an all-in method of runic divination, placing the whole situation into one rune.  This shouldn't suggest that the reading will be without relevance or power.  Instead, few methods are as strong as this.  This approach to a question or situation is as sharp as a single thrust from Odins spear, Gungnir.  The absolute nature of the answers provided by this are not for the faint of heart.</p>

For every month, two runes are pulled, and in this way we have a good picture of what the coming year has in store or what to look out for during those months.  This method of runic divination allows us to look forward and see when we might have times to prepare for, to save for, to take action, to lay low.</p>

The cards are laid out in a grid pattern and those images that result are what the reading will focus on.  Most commonly, this oracle is consulted during New Years to get a picture of what the coming year will hold in store.
