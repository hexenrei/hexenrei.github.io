			<br>
			<br>
			What's in a name?  Everything.  One can search the world over and find a common thread amongst all human cultures.  That thread is that there is power in knowing the name of a thing.  Names are given, names are found, names are created, and some names are hidden.  So then where does the name <i>Hexenrei</i> come from?
			<br>
			<br>
			Hexenrei is then a German word, or rather, a constructed German word.  The word <i>Hexen</i> translates to Witch in English.  The ending, <i>rei</i> is similar to how English uses <i>ery</i> to end some words (e.g. Bakery, Smithery).  We then have a word that means something close to a <i>Witchery</i>, or a place where Witching is done.  This is exactly what you will find here.

		<div class="row" id="text1">

				<br>
				<br>
				All services at Hexenrei are DONATION based.  
				<br>

				Divinations are a kind of consultation with a third party.  That third party takes the form of a divinatory tool, most commonly a deck of tarot cards.  The tool used to divine is selected by the practicioner by looking at how well they resonate with it.  At Hexenrei, you will find Tarot, Runic, and Russian Card divinations being offered.  But what are the tools we use here all about?

		<div class="section_subtitle">A bit about Tarot</div>
		<div class="row" id="text1">
			<div class="col-md-6">
			<br>
			<br>
			Simply put, Tarot is a deck of cards with mysterious origins.  Some say they date back to times long forgotten, others say the Egyptians created them.  The most likely historical case that we can conclude is that the Tarot, as we have it today, originated in Italy and France around the mid 15th century.  
			<br>
			<br>
			A deck of Tarot cards usually consists of 78, although some decks may have more or less.  The deck is divided into two sections, the Major and Minor Arcana.  The minor arcana is most similar to our current deck of playing cards, consisting of four suits, fifty-two cards in total.  The major arcana is the additional twenty-two cards, and are the more archtypical Tarot that is portrayed in popular culture such as Death and The Lovers.

		<div class="section_subtitle">A bit about Runes</div>
		<div class="row" id="text1">
			<div class="col-md-6">
			<br>
			<br>
			Runes come from ancient Germanic tribes when these symbols were used as an alphabet.  Interestingly, the use of Runes as a divination tool is a fairly recent convention.  We do however have evidence of the old Norsemen using the runes to enscribe various spells and charms onto objects in an apparent effort to imbue those qualities into the item.  Appropriately enough, the word Rune itself means Mystery.
			<br>
			<br>
			Today, they are still used in this way, in addition to the divination facet that you will find here at Hexenrei.  We now have a meaning behind each letter, or Rune, that we use to build a reading.  Like the Tarot, we have certain layouts that give the symbols of the Runes a structure to build a narrative.

		<div class="section_subtitle" >A bit about the Russian Cards</div>
		<div class="row" id="text1">
			<div class="col-md-6">
			<br>
			<br>
			While we might not have the original set of cards, we can say that the current Russian Card set is based in traditional gypsy methods and symbols.  Reconstructed by Svetlana Alexandrovna Touchkoff, published in 1991, this unique deck captures traditional Russian methods of divination.
			<br>
			<br>
			The deck itself consists of 25 cards.  Each card has four images, each being a half image.  When the layout is complete, one looks for any half images that have again come together to form a full image.  These are where the meaning of the reading comes from, each full image having its own messages.

For this reading we will be able to get advice on the past, present, and future.  In other words, what was, is, and should be.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-4">
				<p class="description">The Celtic Cross layout is one of the most commonly used layouts in Tarot readings.  There is a good reason for this.  The Celtic Cross is able to examine a specific question in great detail and only uses ten cards.  One is able to get a full view of the issue, where it comes from, what it's rooted in, things to look out for, and what might be in the future.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-4">
				<p class="description">The Pentagram layout incorporates the timeless symbol of the Pentagram and its own elemental meanings into the symbols of the Tarot.  This layout provides one with an elemental picture of any situation, what lays rooted in Earth, what burns away in the Hearts Fire, what stirs in the Winds, what dives in the Waters, and what the true Spirit of the situation is.</p>

				<p class="description">The Journey layout is perfect for looking at your options.  The aspect this layout is best at focusing in on is ... the journey itself.  From the starting point in the present, we move forward, seeing what we might encounter if we choose certain paths.  At the end of the layout, we arrive at a destination, the result of all the possible paths.  Here we can see which roads look more promising on the way to where we are going.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-4">
				<p class="description">The Branching Path layout let's us examine our choices in detail.  Here we can ask the question...what if...and get a good answer.  Starting at the present, we can see where each choice, each crossroad, might take us.  Here then we have a kind of branching timeline, a snapshot of all possibilities spreading out from where we are now in time.  The Branching Path might not give us a glimpse of a final destination, but it can give us a great map to navigate with.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-4">
				<p class="description">Perhaps one of the most simple layouts, and yet, Duality provides us with a suprising amount of depth.  A simple two card, pull, we can see all aspects of duality in regards to the issue being looked into.  What is strong and weak, what is known and unkown, what is now and later, what is to be accumulated and what is to be avoided...all dualites are revealed.  While it's true that subtlties might be lost here, this reading is perfect for getting a wide-view of a situation.</p>

				<p class="description">The Norns were agents of Fate in Norse mythology. An interesting question arises from them and their prophecy...by divining the future are we simply exercising forsight, or are we in fact creating it? Perhaps we may never find the answer, but in using this reading we might explore this question. The Norn layout is a three Rune pull, one for each of the Norns. We can catch a glimpse of our timeline in this, what was, is, and should be.</p>

				<p class="description">On the mighty World Tree Yggdrasil hang the Nine Worlds. This reading is a powerful one which allows a vantage point that encompasses all the known realms. The Nine Worlds reading can be applied to your own personal worlds or the worlds at large. Combining the Runes with Norse Mythology, a unique and rich reading results. A single rune is pulled for each realm, showing the state of affairs in the realm and in turn the worlds at large.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-4">
				<p class="description">For the Falling Leaves method of runic divination, all of the Runes are used at once. Taking them all up, they are all cast down. The ones facing up are the ones who wish to speak. Charting those runes showing, their spatial relation to each other, and at times utilizing the nine worlds map, an in depth rune reading results. Always unpredictable, this method provides a truly free form result that is often suprising in what it wants to tell us.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="col-md-4">
				<p class="description">The most simple and quick advice the runes can give. Pulling one rune is an all-in method of runic divination, placing the whole situation into one rune. This shouldn't suggest that the reading will be without relevance or power. Instead, few methods are as strong as this. This approach to a question or situation is as sharp as a single thrust from Odins spear, Gungnir. The absolute nature of the answers provided by this are not for the faint of heart.</p>

				<p class="description">The Wheel of the Year is a long term forecast, looking ahead exactly one year from the date the runes are cast. For every month, two runes are pulled, and in this way we have a good picture of what the coming year has in store or what to look out for during those months. This method of runic divination allows us to look forward and see when we might have times to prepare for, to save for, to take action, to lay low.</p>
